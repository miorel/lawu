      <h1> Title Section</h1>
<p>This section contains records used to describe the experiment and the biological macromolecules 
present in the entry: HEADER, OBSLTE, TITLE, CAVEAT, COMPND, SOURCE, KEYWDS, 
EXPDTA, AUTHOR, REVDAT, SPRSDE, JRNL, and REMARK records.
HEADER</p>

<P><HR noshade></P>
<h2><a name="HEADER">HEADER</a></h2>
<b>Overview</b>
<p>The HEADER record uniquely identifies a PDB entry through the idCode field. This record also 
provides a classification for the entry. Finally, it contains the date the coordinates were deposited at 
the PDB. </p>
<b>Record Format</b>
<p>

                                              This is the date the coordinates were 
                                              received by the PDB
63 - 66      IDcode         idCode            This identifier is unique within the PDB
</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>The classification string is left-justified and exactly matches one of a collection of strings. See the class list available from the WWW site. In the case of macromolecular complexes, the classification field must present a class for each macromolecule present. Due to the limited length of the classification field, strings must sometimes be abbreviated. In these cases, the full terms are given in KEYWDS.  </li>
<li>Classification may be based on function, metabolic role, molecule type, cellular location, etc. In the case of a molecule having a dual function, both may be presented here.</li>
</p>
<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p> The verification program checks that the deposition date is a legitimate date and that the ID code is 
well-formed. </p>
<p>PDB coordinate entry ID codes do not begin with 0, as this is used to identify the NOC ("no 
coordinates) files that are bibliographic only, not structural entries. </p>
<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>The classification found in HEADER also appears in KEYWDS, unabbreviated and in no strict order.</p>

</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>The title of the entry is free text and should describe the contents of the entry and any procedures or 
conditions that distinguish this entry from similar entries. It presents an opportunity for the depositor to 
emphasize the underlying purpose of this particular experiment. </li>
<li>Some items that may be included in TITLE are:</li>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
 - Experiment type.
 - Description of the mutation.
 - The fact that only alpha carbon coordinates have been provided in the entry.
</pre>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>This record is free text so no verification of format is required. The title is supplied by the depositor, 
but PDB staff may exercise editorial judgment in consultation with depositors in assigning the title. </p>
<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>COMPND, SOURCE, EXPDTA, and REMARKs provide information that may also be found in TITLE. 
You may think of the title as describing the experiment, and the compound record as describing the 
molecule(s). </p>

<h2><a name="COMPND">COMPND</a></h2>
<b>Overview</b>
<p>The COMPND record describes the macromolecular contents of an entry. Each macromolecule found 
in the entry is described by a set of token: value pairs, and is referred to as a COMPND record 
component. Since the concept of a molecule is difficult to specify exactly, PDB staff may exercise 
editorial judgment in consultation with depositors in assigning these names.</p>

<p>
<li>The compound record is a Specification list. The specifications, or tokens, that may be used are 
listed below:</li>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
TOKEN         VALUE DEFINITION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOL_ID        Numbers each component; also used in SOURCE to associate the information.
MOLECULE      Name of the macromolecule.
CHAIN         Comma-separated list of chain identifier(s). 
FRAGMENT      Specifies a domain or region of the molecule.
SYNONYM       Comma-separated list of synonyms for the MOLECULE.
EC            The Enzyme Commission number associated with the
              molecule. If there is more than one EC number, they
              are presented as a comma-separated list.
ENGINEERED    Indicates that the molecule was produced using
              recombinant technology or by purely chemical synthesis.
MUTATION      Indicates if there is a mutation.
OTHER_DETAILS Additional comments.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<li>In the general case the PDB tends to reflect the biological/functional view of the molecule. For 
example, the hetero-tetramer hemoglobin molecule is treated as a discrete component in COMPND.</li>
<li>In the case of synthetic molecules, e. g., hybrids, the depositor will provide the description.</li>
<li>No specific rules apply to the ordering of the tokens, except that the occurrence of MOL_ID or 
FRAGMENT indicates that the subsequent tokens are related to that specific molecule or fragment of 
the molecule.</li>
<li>Asterisks in nucleic acid names (in MOLECULE) are for ease of reading.</li>
<li>When insertion codes are given as part of the residue name, they must be given within square 
brackets, i.e., H57[A]N. This might occur when listing residues in FRAGMENT or OTHER_DETAILS.</li>
<li>For multi-chain molecules, e.g., the hemoglobin tetramer, a comma-separated list of CHAIN 
identifiers is used.</li>
<li>When non-blank chain identifiers occur in the entry, they must be specified.</li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>CHAIN must match the chain identifiers(s) of the molecule(s). EC numbers are also checked</p>
<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>In the case of mutations, the SEQADV records will present differences from the reference molecule.
REMARK records may further describe the contents of the entry. Also see verification above.</p>

<li>The srcName is a list of token: value pairs describing each biological component of the entry. </li>
<li>As in COMPND, the order is not specified except that MOL_ID or FRAGMENT indicates subsequent 
specifications are related to that molecule or fragment of the molecule. </li>
<li>Physical layout of these items may be altered by PDB staff to improve human readability of the 
SOURCE record.</li>
<li>Only the relevant tokens need to appear in an entry</li>
<li>Molecules prepared by purely chemical synthetic methods are described by the specification 
SYNTHETIC followed by "YES" or an optional value, such as NON-BIOLOGICAL SOURCE or 
BASED ON THE NATURAL SEQUENCE. ENGINEERED must appear in the COMPND record. </li>
<li>In the case of a chemically synthesized molecule using a biologically functional sequence (nucleic 
or amino acid), SOURCE reflects the biological origin of the sequence and COMPND reflects its 
synthetic nature by inclusion of the token ENGINEERED. The token SYNTHETIC appears in 
SOURCE.</li>
<li>If made from a synthetic gene, ENGINEERED appears in COMPND and the expression system is 
described in SOURCE (SYNTHETIC does NOT appear in SOURCE).</li>
<li>If the molecule was made using recombinant techniques, ENGINEERED appears in COMPND and 
the system is described in SOURCE. </li>
<li>When multiple macromolecules appear in the entry, each MOL_ID, as given in the COMPND 
record, must be repeated in the SOURCE record along with the source information for the 
corresponding molecule. </li>
<li>Hybrid molecules prepared by fusion of genes are treated as multi-molecular systems for the 
purpose of specifying the source. The token FRAGMENT is used to associate the source with its 
corresponding fragment. </li>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
 - When necessary to fully describe hybrid molecules, tokens may appear
   more than once for a given MOL_ID.
 - All relevant token: value pairs that taken together fully describe 
   each fragment are grouped following the appropriate FRAGMENT.
 - Descriptors relative to the full system appear before the FRAGMENT 
   (see Example 3 below).
</p>
</pre>
<p>
<li>ORGANISM_SCIENTIFIC provides the Latin genus and species. Virus names are listed as the 
scientific name. </li>
<li>Cellular origin is described by giving cellular compartment, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, or body 
part from which the molecule was isolated.</li>
<li>CELLULAR_LOCATION may be used to indicate where in the organism the compound was found. 
Examples are: extracellular, periplasmic, cytosol.</li>
<li>Entries containing molecules prepared by recombinant techniques are described as follows: </li>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
 - The expression system is described.
 - The organism and cell location given are for the source of 
   the gene used in the cloning experiment.
 - Transgenic organisms, such as mouse producing human proteins, 
   are treated as expression systems.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<li>For a theoretical modeling experiment, SOURCE describes the modelled compound just as though 
it were an experimental study. </li>
<li>New tokens may be added by the PDB. </li>

<h2><a name="KEYWDS">KEYWDS</a></h2>
<b>Overview</b>
<p>The KEYWDS record contains a set of terms relevant to the entry. Terms in the KEYWDS record 
provide a simple means of categorizing entries and may be used to generate index files. This record 
addresses some of the limitations found in the classification field of the HEADER record. It provides 
the opportunity to add further annotation to the entry in a concise and computer-searchable fashion.

</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>The KEYWDS record contains a list of terms relevant to the entry, similar to that found in journal 
articles. A phrase may be used if it presents a single concept (e.g., reaction center). Terms provided 
in this record may include those that describe the following: </li></p>

<p>
<pre>
  - Functional classification. 
  - Metabolic role. 
  - Known biological or chemical activity. 
  - Structural classification. 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<li>Other classifying terms may be used. No ordering is required for these terms. A number of PDB 
entries contain complexes of macromolecules. In these cases, all terms applicable to each molecule 
should be provided. </li>
<li>Note that the terms in the KEYWDS record duplicate those found in the classification field of the 
HEADER record. Terms abbreviated in the HEADER record are unabbreviated in KEYWDS, and the 
parentheses used in HEADER are optional in KEYWDS.</li></p>
<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control </b>
<p>
Terms used in the KEYWDS record are subject to scientific and editorial review. A list of terms, 
definitions, and synonyms will be maintained at the PDB. Every attempt will be made to provide some 
level of consistency with keywords used in other biological databases. </p>
<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p> 
HEADER records contain a classification term which must also appear in KEYWDS. Scientific 
judgment will dictate when terms used in one entry to describe a molecule should be included in other 
entries with the same or similar molecules.

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>EXPDTA is mandatory and appears in all entries.</li>
<li>The technique must match one of the permitted values. See above.</li>
<li>If more than one model appears in the entry, the number of models included must be stated.</li>
<li>If only one model appears in the entry, its significance must be stated, such as it being a minimized 
average or regularized mean structure.</li>
<li>If more than one technique was used for the structure determination and is being represented in the 
entry, EXPDTA presents the techniques as a semi-colon separated list. Each technique may have a 
comment, which appears before the semi-colon.</li></p>
<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>
The verification program checks that the EXPDTA record appears in the entry and that the technique 
matches one of the allowed values. It also checks that the relevant standard REMARK is added in the 
case of NMR, fiber, or theoretical modeling studies, and that the correct CRYST1 and SCALE are 
used in these cases. If an entry contains multiple models, the verification program checks for the 
correct number of matching MODEL/ENDMDL records. 
</p>
<b>Relationships to Other Record Types </b>
<p>
If the experiment is an NMR, fiber, or theoretical modeling study, this may be stated in the TITLE, and 
the appropriate EXPDTA and REMARK records should appear. Specific details of the data collection 
and experiment appear in the REMARKs. </p>
<p>
In the case of a polycrystalline fiber diffraction study, CRYST1 and SCALE contain the normal unit 
cell data. </p>

<h2><a name="JRNL">JRNL</a></h2>
<b>Overview </b>
<p>
The JRNL record contains the primary literature citation that describes the experiment which resulted 
in the deposited coordinate set. There is at most one JRNL reference per entry. If there is no primary 
reference, then there is no JRNL reference. Other references are given in REMARK 1. </p>

</p>
<b>Details </b>
<p>
<li>The following tables are used to describe the sub-record types of the JRNL record. </li>
<li> The AUTH sub-record is mandatory in JRNL. This is followed by TITL, EDIT, REF, PUBL, and 
REFN sub- record types. REF and REFN are also mandatory in JRNL. EDIT and PUBL may appear 
only if the reference is to a non-journal. </li>
</p>
<h3>1. AUTH </h3>
<p>
<li>AUTH contains the list of authors associated with the cited article or contribution to a larger work 
(i.e., AUTH is not used for the editor of a book). </li>
<li>The author list is formatted similarly to the AUTHOR record. It is a comma-separated list of names. 
Spaces at the end of a sub-record are not significant; all other spaces are significant. See the 
AUTHOR record for full details.</li>
<li>The authorList field of continuation sub-records in JRNL differs from that in AUTHOR by leaving no 
leading blank in column 20 of any continuation lines. </li>
<li>One author's name, consisting of the initials and family name, cannot be split across two lines. If 
there are continuation sub-records, then all but the last sub-record must end in a comma. </li>
</p>

20 - 70        List            authorList     List of the authors.               
</pre>
</p>
<h3>2. TITL </h3>
<p>
<li>TITL specifies the title of the reference. This is used for the title of a journal article, chapter, or part 
of a book. The TITL line is omitted if the author(s) listed in authorList wrote the entire book (or other 
work) listed in REF and no section of the book is being cited.</li>
<li>If an article is in a language other than English and is printed with an alternate title in English, the 
English language title is given, followed by a space and then the name of the language (in its English 
form, in square brackets) in which the article is written. </li>
<li>If the title of an article is in a non-Roman alphabet the title is transliterated. </li>
<li>The actual title cited is reconstructed in a manner identical to other continued records, i.e., trailing 
blanks are discarded and the continuation line is concatenated with a space inserted. </li>
<li>A line cannot end with a hyphen. A compound term (two elements connected by a hyphen) or 
chemical names which include a hyphen must appear on a single line, unless they are too long to fit 
on one line, in which case the split is made at a normally-occurring hyphen. An individual word cannot 
be hyphenated at the end of a line and put on two lines. An exception is when there is a repeating 
compound term where the second element is omitted, e.g., "DOUBLE- AND TRIPLE-RESONANCE". 
In such a case the non-completed word "DOUBLE-" could end a line and not alter reconstruction of 
the title. </li>

<h3>4. REF</h3>
<p>
<li>REF is a group of fields that contain either the publication status or the name of the publication (and 
any supplement and/or report information), volume, page, and year. There are two forms of this sub-
record group, depending upon the citation's publication status. </li>
<li>4a. If the reference has not been published yet, the sub-record type group has the form:</li>
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 COLUMNS         DATA TYPE            FIELD                   DEFINITION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6         Record name          "JRNL "
13 - 16         LString(3)           "REF"
20 - 34         LString(15)          "TO BE PUBLISHED"
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<it>Publication name (first item in pubName field):</it><br>
<li>If the publication is a serial (i.e., a journal, an annual, or other non-book or non-monographic item 
issued in parts and intended to be continued indefinitely), use the abbreviated name of the publication 
as listed in PubMed and with periods.</li>
<li>If the publication is a book, monograph, or other non-serial item, use its full name according to the 
Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, 2nd Ed., 1988 revision (AACR2R). (Non-serial items include 
theses, videos, computer programs, and anything that is complete in one or a finite number of parts.) 
If there is a sub-title, and the item is verified in an online catalog, it will be included using the same 
punctuation as in the source of verification. Preference will be given to verification using cataloging of 
the Library of Congress, the National Library of Medicine, and the British Library, in that order.</li>
<li>If a book is part of a monographic series: the full name of the book (according to AACR2R) is listed 
first, followed by the name of the series in which it was published. The series information is given 
within parentheses and the series name is preceded by "IN:" and a space. If the series has  A.C.S. 
abbreviation, that abbreviation should be used; otherwise the series name should be listed in full. If 
applicable, the series name should be followed, after a comma and a space, by a volume (V.) and/or 
number (NO.) and/or part (PT.) indicator and the relevant characters to indicate its number and/or 
letter in the series. </li>
</p>
<p>
<it>Supplement (follows publication name in pubName field):</it>
<li>If a reference is in a supplement to the volume listed, or if information about a "part" is needed to 
distinguish multiple parts with the same page numbering, such information should be put in the REF 
sub-record. </li>
<li>A supplement indication should follow the name of the publication and should be preceded by a 
comma and a space. Supplement should be abbreviated as "SUPPL." If there is a supplement 
number or letter, it should follow "SUPPL." without an intervening space. A part indication should also 
follow the name of the publication and be preceded by a comma and a space. A part should be 
abbreviated as "PT.", and the number or letter should follow without an intervening space.</li>
<li>If there is both a supplement and a part, their order should reflect the order printed on the work 
itself. </li>
</p>
<p>
<it>Report (follows publication name and any supplement or part information in pubName field):</it><br>
<li>If a book has a report designation, the report information should follow the title and precede series 
information. The name and number of the report is given in parentheses, and the name is  preceded 
by "REPORT:" and a space. </li>
</p>
<p>
<it>Reconstruction of publication name:</it><br>
<li>The name of the publication is reconstructed by removing any trailing blanks in the pubName field, 
and concatenating all of the pubName fields from the continuation lines with an intervening space. 
There are two conditions where no intervening space is added between lines: when the pubName 
field on a line ends with a hyphen or a period, or when the line ends with a hyphen (-). When the line 
ends with a period (.), add a space if this is the only period in the entire pubName field; do not add a 
space if there are two or more periods throughout the pubName field, excluding any periods after the 
designations "SUPPL", "V", "NO", or "PT". </li>
</p>
<p>
<it>Volume, page, and year (volume, page, year fields respectively):</it><br>
<li>The REF sub-record type group also contains information about volume, page, and year when 
applicable.</li>
<li>In the case of a monograph with multiple volumes which is also in a numbered series, the number in 
the volume field represents the number of the book, not the series. (The volume number of the series 
is in parentheses with the name of the series, as described above under publication name.)</li>

<h3>5. PUBL</h3>
<p>
<li>PUBL contains the name of the publisher and place of publication if the reference is to a book or 
other non- journal publication. If the non-journal has not yet been published or released, this sub-
record is absent. </li>
<li>The place of publication is listed first, followed by a space, a colon, another space, and then the 
name of the publisher/issuer. This arrangement is based on the ISBD(M) International Standard 
Bibliographic Description for Monographic Publications (Rev.Ed., 1987) and AACR2R and is used in 
public online catalogs in libraries. Details on the contents of PUBL are given below.</li>
</p>
<p><it>Place of publication: </it><br>
<li>Give the place of publication. If the name of the country, state, province, etc. is considered 
necessary to distinguish the place of publication from others of the same name, or for identification, 
then follow the city with a comma, a space, and the name of the larger geographic area. </li>
<li>If there is more than one place of publication, only the first listed will be used. If an online catalog 
record is used to verify the item, the first place listed there will be used, omitting any brackets. 
Preference will be given to the cataloging done by the Library of Congress, the National Library of 
Medicine, and the British Library, in that order. </li>
</p>
<p><it>Publisher's name (or name of other issuing entity):</it><br>
<li>Give the name of the publisher in the shortest form in which it can be understood and identified 
internationally, according to AACR2R rule 1.4D.</li>
<li>If there is more than one publisher listed in the publication, only the first will be used in the PDB file. 
If an online catalog record is used to verify the item, the first place listed there will be used for the 
name of the publisher. Preference will be given to the cataloging of the Library of Congress, the 
National Library of Medicine, and the British Library, in that order. </li>
</p>
<p><it> Ph.D. and other theses:</it><br>
<li>Theses are presented in the PUBL record if the degree has been granted and the thesis made 
available for public consultation by the degree-granting institution. </li>
<li>The name of the degree-granting institution (the issuing agency) is followed by a space and 
"(THESIS)". </li>
</p>
<p><it>Reconstruction of place and publisher:</it><br>
<li>The PUBL sub-record type can be reconstructed by removing all trailing blanks in the pub field and 
concatenating all of the pub fields from the continuation lines with an intervening space. </li>
</p>
<p>
Continued lines do not begin with a space.</p>

<h3>6. REFN</h3>
<p>
<li>REFN is a group of fields that contain encoded references to the citation. No continuation lines are 
possible. Each piece of coded information has a designated field. </li>
<li>The country field is blank if the reference was published in more than one country.</li>
<li>If more than one ISBN is known, select one that matches the individual volume cited (if it happens to 
be in a set that also has an ISBN for the set). If the reason for multiple ISBNs is that the publication is 
issued in more than one country, use the ISBN for the country of the first listed place of publication. If 
there are hardcover and paperback ISBN numbers, use the ISBN for the hardbound version.</li>
<li>There are two forms of this sub-record type group, depending upon the publication status.</li>

</p>
<b>Known Problems</b>
<p>
<li>Interchange of bibliographic information and linking with other databases is hampered by the lack of 
labels or specific locations for certain types of information or by more than one type of information 
being in a particular location. This is most likely to occur with books, series, and reports. Some of the 
points below provide details about the variations and/or blending of information. </li>
<li>Titles of the publications that require more than 28 characters on the REF line must be continued on 
subsequent lines. There is some awkwardness due to volume, page, and year appearing on the first 
REF line, thereby splitting up the title.</li>
<li>Information about a supplement and its number/letter is presented in the publication's title field (on 
the REF lines in columns 20 - 47). </li>
<li>When series information for a book is presented, it is added to the REF line. The number of REF 
lines can become large in some cases because of the 28-column limit for title information in REF. </li>
<li>There is often an ISBN for a book title and a separate ISSN for the series in which it was published. 
There is no way to present more than one of these. </li>
<li>Books that are issued in more than one series are not accommodated. </li>
<li>Many books are issued in more than one country. The publisher has a separate ISBN number in 
each country. There is no place to put any additional applicable ISBN numbers. </li>
<li>The country code prefix of the ISBN may not match the country of the place of publication that is 
listed on the PUBL line when a book is published in more than one country. </li>
<li>Pagination is limited to the beginning page.</li>
<li>There is no place for listing a reference's accession number in another database.</li>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>PDB entries contain multi-chain molecules with sequences that may be wild type, variant, or 
synthetic. Sequences may also have been modified through site-directed mutagenesis experiments 
(engineered). A number of PDB entries report structures of domains cleaved from larger molecules.</li>
<li>The DBREF record was designed to account for these differences by providing explicit correlations 
between sequences as given in the SEQRES records and the sequence database entry. Several 
cases are easily represented by means of pointers between the databases using DBREF. PDB 
entries containing heteropolymers are linked to different sequence database entries.  </li>

<h2><a name="SEQADV">SEQADV</a></h2>
<b>Overview</b>
<p>The SEQADV record identifies conflicts between sequence information in the SEQRES records of the 
PDB entry and the sequence database entry given on DBREF. Please note that these records were 
designed to identify differences and not errors. No assumption is made as to which database contains 
the correct data. PDB may include REMARK records in the entry that reflect the depositor's view of 
which database has the correct sequence. </p>

50 - 70       LString         conflict  Conflict comment.
</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>In a number of cases, conflicts between the sequences found in PDB entries and in PIR or SWISS-
PROT entries have been noted. There are several possible reasons for these conflicts, including 
natural variants or engineered sequences (mutants), polymorphic sequences, or ambiguous or 
conflicting experimental results. These discrepancies, which were previously described in REMARK 
records, are now reported in SEQRES.  </li>
<li>SEQADV describes conflicts between residue sequences given by SEQRES records and those
in the appropriate sequence database entry.</li>
<li>Some of the possible conflict comments:</li>
</p>
<p>
<pre>
       Cloning artifact
       Conflict
       Engineered
       Disordered
       Variant
       Insertion
       Deletion
       Microheterogeneity
       D-configuration
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<li>When conflicts arise which are not classifiable by these terms, a reference to either a published 
paper, a PDB entry, or a REMARK within the entry is given. </li>
<li>Finally, the comment "SEE REMARK 999" is included when the explanation for the conflict is too 
long to fit the SEQADV record. </li>
<li>Microheterogeneity is to be represented as a variant with one of the possible residues in the site 
being selected (arbitrarily) as the primary residue, in which case a SEQADV record must be provided 
for the alternate residue. </li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>
SEQADV records are automatically generated by the PDB.</p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>SEQADV refers to the sequence as found in the SEQRES records, and to the sequence database
reference found on DBREF.</p>

<p>REMARK 999 contains text that explains discrepancies when the explanation is too lengthy to fit in 
SEQADV.</p>

<b>Known Problems</b>

<p>Polysaccharides do not lend themselves to being represented in SEQRES. </p>

<p>There is no mechanism provided to describe sequence runs when the exact ordering of the sequence 
is not known. </p>

<p>For cyclic peptides, PDB arbitrarily assigns a residue as the N-terminus. </p>

<p>No distinction is made between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides in the SEQRES records. These 
residues are identified with the same residue name (i.e., A, C, G, T, U).</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>Residues modified post-translationally, enzymatically, or by design are described in MODRES 
records. In those cases where PDB has opted to use a non-standard residue name for the residue, 
MODRES also provides a mapping to the precursor standard residue name. </li>
<li>MODRES is mandatory for when modified standard residues exist in the entry. </li>

</pre>
</p>
<p>
<li>MODRES is not required if coordinate records are not provided for the modified residue.</li>
<li>D-amino acids are given their own resName , i.e., DAL for D-alanine. This resName appears in the 
SEQRES records, and has the associated SEQADV, MODRES, HET, and FORMUL records. The 
coordinates are given as HETATMs within the ATOM records and occur in the correct order within the 
chain. This ordering is an exception to the stated Order of Records. </li>
<li>When a standard residue name is used to describe a modified site, resName (columns 13-15) and 
stdRES (columns 25-27) contain the same value. </li>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>MODRES is generated by the PDB.</p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>

<p>MODRES maps ATOM and HETATM records to the standard residue names. SEQADV, HET, and
FORMUL may also appear.</p>

      <h1>Heterogen Section</h1>
<p>The heterogen section of a PDB file contains the complete description of non-standard residues in the 
entry.</p>

<h2><a name="HET">HET</a></h2>

<b>Overview</b>
<p>HET records are used to describe non-standard residues, such as prosthetic groups, inhibitors, 
solvent molecules, and ions for which coordinates are supplied. Groups are considered HET if they 
are not part of a biological polymer described in SEQRES and considered to be a molecule bound to 
the polymer, or they are a chemical species that constitutes part of a biological polymer that is not 
one of the following:</p>
<p>
<li>not one of the standard amino acids, and</li>
<li>not one of the nucleic acids (C, G, A, T, U, and I), and</li>
<li>not an unknown amino acid or nucleic acid where UNK is used to indicate the unknown residue name.</li>
</p>
<p>Het records also describe heterogens for which the chemical identity is unknown, in which case the 
group is assigned the hetID UNL (Unknown Ligand). </p>

</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>Each HET group is assigned a hetID of not more than three (3) alphanumeric characters. The 
sequence number, chain identifier, insertion code, and number of coordinate records are given for 
each occurrence of the HET group in the entry. The chemical name of the HET group is given in the 
HETNAM record and synonyms for the chemical name are given in the HETSYN records, see 
http://deposit.pdb.org/public-component-erf.cif.</li>
<li>There is a separate HET record for each occurrence of the HET group in an entry.</li>
<li>A particular HET group is represented in the PDB archives with a unique hetID.</li>
<li>PDB entries do not have HET records for water molecules, deuterated water, or methanol (when 
used as solvent).</li>
<li>Unknown atoms or ions will be represented as UNX with the chemical formula X1.  Unknown 
ligands are UNL; unknown amino acids are UNK.</li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>For each het group that appears in the entry, PDB checks that the corresponding HET, HETNAM, 
HETSYN, FORMUL, HETATM, and CONECT records appear, if applicable. The HET record is 
generated automatically by PDB using the het group dictionary and information from the HETATM 
records. </p>
<p>Each unique hetID represents a unique molecule.</p>
<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>For each het group that appears in the entry, the corresponding HET, HETNAM, HETSYN, FORMUL,
HETATM, and CONECT records must appear, if applicable. LINK records may also appear.</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>The initial residue for a strand is its N-terminus. Strand registration information is provided in 
columns 39 - 70. Strands are listed starting with one edge of the sheet and continuing to the spatially 
adjacent strand. </li>
<li>The sense in columns 39 - 40 indicates whether strand n is parallel (sense = 1) or anti-parallel 
(sense = -1) to strand n-1. Sense is equal to zero (0) for the first strand of a sheet. </li>
<li>The registration (columns 42 - 70) of strand n to strand n-1 may be specified by one hydrogen bond 
between each such pair of strands. This is done by providing the hydrogen bonding between the 
current and previous strands. No registration information should be provided for the first strand. </li>
<li>Split strands, or strands with two or more runs of residues from discontinuous parts of the amino 
acid sequence, are explicitly listed. Provide a description to be included in the REMARK section. </li>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>Turns include those sets of residues which form beta turns, i.e., have a hydrogen bond linking (C-
O)i to (N-H)i +3. Turns which link residue i to i+2 (gamma-bends) may also be included. Others may 
be also be classified as turns. </li>
<li>The initial residue is the N-terminus.</li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>
The validation program checks the number of residues in the given turn. PDB verifies that named 
residues exist in the ATOM records. </p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>
There may be related information in the REMARKs.</p>

<p>If SG of cysteine is disordered then there are possible alternate linkages. PDB's practice is to put 
together all possible SSBOND records. This is problematic because the alternate location identifier is 
not specified in the SSBOND record.</p>

<h2><a name="LINK">LINK</a></h2>

<b>Overview</b>
<p>
The LINK records specify connectivity between residues that is not implied by the primary structure.
Connectivity is expressed in terms of the atom names. This record supplements information given in
CONECT records and is provided here for convenience in searching.</p>

<b>Details </b>
<p>
<li>The atoms involved in bonds between HET groups or between a HET group and standard residue 
are listed.</li>
<li>Interresidue linkages not implied by the primary structure are listed (e.g., reduced peptide bond).</li>
<li>Non-standard linkages between residues, e.g., side-chain to side-chain, are listed.</li>
<li>Each LINK record specifies one linkage.</li>
<li>These records do not specify connectivity within a HET group (see CONECT) or disulfide bridges 
(see SSBOND).</li>
<li>sym1 and sym2 are given as blank when the identity operator (and no cell translation) is to be 
applied to the atom. </li>
<li>For NMR entries only one set (or model) of LINK records will be supplied. <li>
</p>
<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>
The distance between the pair of atoms listed must be consistent with the bonding.</p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>CONECT records are generated from LINKs when both atoms are present in the entry. If symmetry 
operators are given to generate one of the residues involved in the bond, REMARK 290 defines the 
symmetry transformation. </p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>Site records specify residues comprising catalytic, cofactor, anticodon, regulatory or other important 
sites or environments surrounding ligands present in the structure. </li>
<li>The sequence number (columns 8 - 10) is reset to 1 for each new site. </li>
<li>SITE identifiers (columns 12 - 14) should be fully explained in a remark. </li>
<li>If a site is comprised of more than four residues, these may be specified on additional records 
bearing the same site identifier.</li>
<li>SITE records can include HET groups. </li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control </b>
<p>
Every SITE must have a corresponding remark that describes it. The numbering of sequential SITE 
records and format of each one is verified, as well as the existence of each residue in the ATOM 
records. </p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>
Each listed SITE needs a corresponding REMARK 800 that details its significance.</p>

</p>
<b> Details</b><br>
<p>
<li>If the coordinate entry describes a structure determined by a technique other than crystallography, CRYST1 contains a = b = c = 1.0, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees, space group = P 1, and Z = 1.</li>
<li>The Hermann-Mauguin space group symbol is given without parenthesis, e.g., P 43 21 2. Please note that the screw axis is described as a two digit number. </li>
<li>The full international Hermann-Mauguin symbol is used, e.g., P 1 21 1 instead of P 21</li>
<li>For a rhombohedral space group in the hexagonal setting, the lattice type symbol used is H</li>
<li>The Z value is the number of polymeric chains in a unit cell. In the case of heteropolymers, Z is the number of occurrences of the most populous chain.</li>
</p>
<p> 
As an example, given two chains A and B, each with a different sequence, and the space
group P 2 that has two equipoints in the standard unit cell, the following table gives the
correct Z value.</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b><br>
<p>The given space group and Z values are checked during processing for correctness and internal 
consistency. The calculated SCALE is compared to that supplied by the depositor. Packing is also 
computed, and close contacts of symmetry-related molecules are diagnosed. 
</p>
<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>The unit cell parameters are used to calculate SCALE. If the EXPDTA record is NMR, 
THEORETICAL MODEL, or FIBER DIFFRACTION, FIBER, the CRYST1 record is predefined as </p><br>
a = b = c = 1.0, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees, space group = P 1 and Z = 1. <br>
<p>In these cases, an explanatory REMARK must also appear in the entry. Some fiber 
diffraction structures will be done this way, while others will have a CRYST1 record containing measured values.

<b>Details</b><br>
<p>
<li>The PDB supplies this information even if the transformation is an identity transformation (unit 
matrix, null vector). See the SCALE section of this document for a definition of the default orthogonal 
Angstroms system. </li>
<li>If the original submitted coordinates are Xsub, Ysub, Zsub and the orthogonal Angstroms 
coordinates contained in the data entry are X, Y, Z, then: </li>
</p>
<pre>
       Xsub = O11X + O12Y + O13Z + T1
       Ysub = O21X + O22Y + O23Z + T2

</pre>
<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b><br>
<p>If the coordinates are submitted in the same orthogonal Angstrom coordinate frame as they appear in 
the entry (the usual case), then ORIGX is an identity matrix with a null translation vector. If the 
transformation is not an identity matrix with a null translation vector, then applying this transformation 
to the coordinates in the entry yields the coordinates in the original deposited file.

</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>This record is used only when more than one model appears in an entry. Generally, it is employed 
only for NMR structures. The chemical connectivity should be the same for each model. ATOM, 
HETATM, SIGATM, SIGUIJ, ANISOU, and TER records for each model structure are interspersed as 
needed between MODEL and ENDMDL records. </li>
<li>The numbering of models is sequential beginning with 1. </li>
<li>If a collection contains more than 99,999 total atoms, then more than one entry must be made. In 
such a case the collection is divided between models (between an ENDMDL and the following 
MODEL record) and the model numbering is sequential throughout such a set of entries. </li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>Entries with multiple structures in the EXPDTA record are checked for corresponding pairs of 
MODEL/ ENDMDL records, and for consecutively numbered models. </p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>Each MODEL must have a corresponding ENDMDL record.</p>
<p>In the case of an NMR entry the EXPDTA record states the number of model structures that are 
present in the individual entry.</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>ATOM records for proteins are listed from amino to carboxyl terminus. </li>
<li>Nucleic acid residues are listed from the 5' to the 3' terminus. </li>
<li>No ordering is specified for polysaccharides. </li>
<li>The list of ATOM records in a chain is terminated by a TER record. </li>
<li>If more than one model is present in the entry, each model is delimited by MODEL and ENDMDL 
records. </li>
<li>If an atom is provided in more than one position, then a non-blank alternate location indicator must 
be used as the alternate location indicator for each of the positions. Within a residue all atoms that 
are associated with each other in a given conformation are assigned the same alternate position 
indicator. </li>
<li>For atoms that are in alternate sites indicated by the alternate site indicator, sorting of atoms in the 
ATOM/ HETATM list uses the following general rules: </li>
</p>
<p>In the simple case that involves a few atoms or a few residues with alternate sites, the coordinates 
occur one after the other in the entry.</p>
<p>In the case of a large heterogen groups which are disordered, the atoms for each conformer are listed 
together. </p>
<p>
<li>The insertion code is commonly used in sequence numbering </li>
<li>If the depositor provides the data, then the isotropic B value is given for the temperature factor.</li>
<li>If there are neither isotropic B values from the depositor, nor anisotropic temperature factors in 
ANISOU, then the default value of 0.0 is used for the temperature factor. </li>
<li>Columns 77 - 78 contain the atom's element symbol (as given in the periodic table), right-justified. </li>
<li>Columns 79 - 80 indicate any charge on the atom, e.g., 2+, 1-. In most cases these are blank.</li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>PDB checks ATOM/HETATM records for PDB format, sequence information, and packing. The PDB 
reserves the right to return deposited coordinates to the author for transformation into PDB format. </p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
<p>
The ATOM records are compared to the corresponding sequence database. Residue discrepancies 
appear in the SEQADV record. Missing atoms are annotated in the remarks. HETATM records are 
formatted in the same way as ATOM records. The sequence implied by ATOM records must be 
identical to that given in SEQRES, with the exception that residues that have no coordinates, e.g., 
due to disorder, must appear in SEQRES. </p>

<h2><a name="TER">TER</a></h2>

<b>Overview</b>
<p>The TER record indicates the end of a list of ATOM/HETATM records for a chain.</p>

<b>Record Format</b>
<p>
<pre>
COLUMNS     DATA TYPE         FIELD           DEFINITION
------------------------------------------------------
 1 - 6      Record name       "TER     "
 7 - 11     Integer           serial          Serial number.
18 - 20     Residue name      resName         Residue name.
22          Character         chainID         Chain identifier.
23 - 26     Integer           resSeq          Residue sequence 
                                              number.
27          AChar             iCode           Insertion code.
</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>Every chain of ATOM/HETATM records presented on SEQRES records is terminated with a TER 
record.</li>
<li>The TER records occur in the coordinate section of the entry, and indicate the last residue 
presented for each polypeptide and/or nucleic acid chain for which there are coordinates. For 
proteins, the residue defined on the TER record is the carboxy-terminal residue; for nucleic acids it is 
the 3'-terminal residue. </li>
<li>For a cyclic molecule, the choice of termini is arbitrary. </li>
<li>Terminal oxygen atoms are presented as OXT for proteins, and as O5T or O3T for nucleic acids. </li>
<li>The TER record has the same residue name, chain identifier, sequence number and insertion code 
as the terminal residue. The serial number of the TER record is one number greater than the serial 
number of the ATOM/HETATM preceding the TER.</li>
</p>
 
<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control</b>
<p>TER must appear at the end carboxy or 3' of a chain. For proteins, there is usually a terminal oxygen, 
labeled OXT. The validation program checks for the occurrence of TER and OXT records. </p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types </b>
<p>The residue name appearing on the TER record must be the same as the residue name of the 
immediately preceding ATOM or non-water HETATM record. </p>

</pre>
</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>MODEL/ENDMDL records are used only when more than one structure is presented in the entry, as 
is often the case with NMR entries. </li>
<li>All the models in a multi-model entry must represent the same structure. </li>
<li>Every MODEL record has an associated ENDMDL record. </li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control </b>
<p>
Entries with multiple structures in the EXPDTA record are checked for corresponding pairs of 
MODEL/ ENDMDL records, and for consecutively numbered models. </p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types</b>
 
<p>There must be a corresponding MODEL record. </p>

<p>In the case of an NMR entry the EXPDTA record states the number of model structures that are 
present in the individual entry. </p>

This section provides information on chemical connectivity. LINK, HYDBND, SLTBRG, and CISPEP 
are found in the Connectivity Annotation section.</p>

<h2><a name="CONECT">CONECT</a></h2>

<b>Overview</b>
<p>
The CONECT records specify connectivity between atoms for which coordinates are supplied. The 
connectivity is described using the atom serial number as found in the entry. CONECT records are 
mandatory for HET groups (excluding water) and for other bonds not specified in the standard residue 
connectivity table which involve atoms in standard residues. These records are generated by the 
PDB.</p>

</p>

<b>Details</b>
<p>
<li>Intra-residue connectivity within non-standard (HET) residues (excluding water) is presented on the 
CONECT records.</li>
<li>Inter-residue connectivity of HET groups to standard groups (including water) or to other HET 
groups are represented on the CONECT records. </li>
<li>Disulfide bridges specified in the SSBOND records have corresponding CONECT records.</li>
<li>No differentiation is made between donor and acceptor for hydrogen bonds. </li>
<li>No differentiation is made between atoms with excess negative or positive charge. </li>
<li>Atoms specified in the connectivity are presented by their serial numbers as found in the entry. </li>
<li>All atoms connected to the atom with serial number in columns 7 - 11 are listed in the remaining 
fields of the record. </li>
<li>If more than four fields are required for non-hydrogen and nonsalt-bridge bonds, a second CONECT 
record with the same atom serial number in columns 7 - 11 will be used. </li>
<li>These CONECT records occur in increasing order of the atom serial numbers they carry in columns 
7 - 11. The target-atom serial numbers carried on these records also occur in increasing order. </li>
<li>The connectivity list given here is redundant in that each bond indicated is given twice, once with 
each of the two atoms involved specified in columns 7 - 11. </li>
<li>For nucleic acids, Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds between bases may be listed, but this is optional. </li>
<li>For hydrogen bonds, when the hydrogen atom is present in the coordinates, PDB generates a 
CONECT record between the hydrogen atom and its acceptor atom. </li>
<li>For NMR entries, CONECT records for all models are generated describing heterogen connectivity 
and others for LINK records.</li>
</p>

<b>Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control </b>
<p>
Connectivity is checked for unusual bond lengths. </p>

<b>Relationships to Other Record Types </b>
<p>
CONECT records must be present in an entry that contains either non-standard groups or disulfide 
bonds. </p>
